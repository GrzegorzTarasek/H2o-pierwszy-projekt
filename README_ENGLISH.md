Big Data Processing – H2O ML Project

Project completed as part of the Big Data Processing course during university studies.
The aim of the project was to use the H2O environment for large-scale data analysis and modeling.

Project objective:

- Main project assumptions:
- working with a large dataset
- data preparation and transformation
- building machine learning models
- comparing algorithm performance
- analysis of prediction quality

The project aimed to provide practical experience with tools used for large-scale data processing.

Technologies used:
- Python
- H2O.ai
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

Scope of implementation

In the project the following were completed:
exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- data cleaning and preprocessing
- splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- building predictive models in the H2O environment
- model evaluation using appropriate metrics
- feature importance analysis

Results:
- comparison of different machine learning algorithms
- identification of the best-performing model based on quality metrics
- practical application of Big Data tools
- gaining experience working with the H2O framework
